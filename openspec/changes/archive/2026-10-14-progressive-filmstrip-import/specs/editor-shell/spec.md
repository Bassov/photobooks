# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Filmstrip placeholders and thumbnails

The filmstrip SHALL list gallery assets horizontally with virtualization for long galleries. Each new asset MUST show an aspect-ratio placeholder before its thumbnail is ready. Thumbnails MUST be orientation-corrected pre-sized previews loaded with asynchronous decoding. The system MUST keep object URLs for thumbnails in a bounded cache and MUST revoke URLs on eviction. During an active multi-file import the filmstrip MUST expose newly enqueued gallery ids as they become part of the gallery (paced so interaction stays within frame-budget gates); it MUST NOT withhold the full batch until import settles. The system MAY reserve scroll extent via a progress spacer for the expected batch size.

#### Scenario: Placeholder then thumbnail

- **WHEN** a supported image enters the gallery during or after import (including a single-file import)
- **THEN** a filmstrip item appears with a placeholder and later shows a preview thumbnail without requiring a full page reload

#### Scenario: Placeholders appear during multi-file import

- **WHEN** a multi-file import is running and gallery ids have been enqueued for accepted files
- **THEN** the filmstrip’s visible gallery count increases before the import progress reaches completion, and placeholders are available to scroll without waiting for the whole batch to finish

#### Scenario: Scroll a long gallery

- **WHEN** the gallery contains far more assets than fit on screen
- **THEN** the user can scroll the filmstrip horizontally and only near-viewport items need live thumbnail resources
